#  Hi, I'm Rishabh 👋

🎓 I'm a student turned full-stack developer with a passion for crafting modern, responsive web applications. I started with front-end development and have since expanded into the full MERN stack — building everything from sleek user interfaces to robust backend systems.

I love working with React and Tailwind CSS on the front end, and diving into Node.js and MongoDB on the back end to bring ideas to life.

## 🔧 Technologies & Tools
- ⚛️ React.js, Redux
- 💨 Tailwind CSS
- 🌐 HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- 🌍 Node.js, Express.js
- 🛢️ MongoDB, Mongoose
- 🔐 JWT, REST APIs
- 🛠️ Git & GitHub
- 📦 NPM, Vite
