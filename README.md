#  Hi, I'm Rishabh 👋

🎓 I'm a student turned full-stack developer with a passion for crafting modern, responsive web applications. I started with front-end development and have since expanded into the full MERN stack — building everything from sleek user interfaces to robust backend systems.

I love working with React and Tailwind CSS on the front end, and diving into Node.js and MongoDB on the back end to bring ideas to life.
